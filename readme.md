# peerserver-webrtc-client

## Description

My alternative to [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/). A more lightweight/low-level solution. Which is compatible with their [PeerServer](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server) signalling server.

## Work in Progress

This is currenly in an alpha stage and not meant to be used by anyone other than me.
